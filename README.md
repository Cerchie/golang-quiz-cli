golang-quiz-cli
===============

This is a fun golang quiz I made to familiarize myself with [oclif](https://oclif.io/). I had a lot of fun building it! I chose TypeScript over JavaScript to keep me honest, and went with the default testing framework so I'd have access to [@oclif/test](https://github.com/oclif/test). 


To get started:

`git clone https://github.com/Cerchie/golang-quiz-cli.git my-folder-name && cd my-folder-name && npm install`

Then, to play:

`./bin/run begin`
